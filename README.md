# i3-Configs
i can't do this again, my most important changes

## Important Things
i3 - renders my stuff
nvim - so i can actually edit without being crippled
joplin - my note taking
synth-shell - bash prompt being colored
.Xresources - changing fonts and sizes
.bashrc - scripts to print some things
pactl - so my audio actually works
